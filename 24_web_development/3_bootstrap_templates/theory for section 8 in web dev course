Boostrap:
Bootstrap is the most popular CSS Framework for developing responsive and mobile-first websites.
Bootstrap 5 is the newest version of Bootstrap..

Writing CSS from scratch is a pain..

Wouldn't it be nice if you can use something that has already been created by somebody so that not every

single developer has to keep reinventing the wheel and keep writing everything from scratch?

And that is the idea behind Bootstrap.

Bootstrap was created to solve this problem so that we can create websites really, really fast by using

somebody else's CSS and building on top of it.

There's also another project called Foundation that does the same thing, and they have their own styles.

But again, bootstrap is the more popular of the two, so we'll focus on that if we click on Get Started



We won't worry too much about that and that's something we'll get into when we get to the JavaScript

section.

But you can see here that with Bootstrap, by just downloading a CSS file and a JavaScript file, we

have all these tools at our disposal.

Now you might be asking yourself one other thing, and that is, well, if everybody uses these, won't

we all have the same looking websites?

And no.

The beauty of bootstrap is that these are just building blocks.

You have all these classes that you can use, but then you can add your own custom CSS styles on top

of these to make it different.

So if I go to buttons, for example, well, by using these classes I have all these beautiful buttons.

But if I wanted to change the behavior of Button primary, which is this one, I could create my own

CSS file and just put it right after the bootstrap file and change the primary color to, let's say,

orange.

And just to show you, if you go to the Expo tab here, Bootstrap actually has a whole bunch of websites

that are have been built with bootstrap and you can see that they all look very, very different.

So in the next video, we're going to build ourself a bootstrap website.

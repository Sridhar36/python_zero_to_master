CSS: CSS are render blocking files. You wont be able to render a web page until the CSS file is received
on server.
By default, CSS is treated as a render blocking resource, which means that the browser won't render any
processed content until the CSSOM is constructed. Make sure to keep your CSS lean, deliver it as quickly
as possible, and use media types and queries to unblock rendering.

some tips to avoid rendering:
1. dont use web links.
2. dont make CSS too big
3. One method people often uses is CSS minify {https://www.cleancss.com/css-minify/} ; you enter your css in compress
block and click minify. Then it removes all the whitespace and the un-necessary stuff.. and reduces your CSS file. Which
saves you few bytes in reality.

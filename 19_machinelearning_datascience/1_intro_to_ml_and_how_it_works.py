You see, it all starts with A.I. or artificial intelligence, which simply means a human intelligence exhibited by
machines. An A.I. is, well, a machine that acts like a human. And currently in our industry we have something called
narrow A.I. that is, machines can be just as good or even better than humans at a specific task.
For example, detecting heart disease from images or at the game of go or even video games.
But narrow A.I. that we have currently simply means those machines can only do one thing really well.
They can't be like humans and have multiple abilities.
That's called General A.I. and it's something that we're very, very far away from.


ML:
Now machine learning is a subset of AI, and machine learning is an approach to try and achieve artificial intelligence
through systems that can find patterns in a set of data. And actually, Stanford University describes machine learning as
the science of getting computers to act without being explicitly programmed.
That is, getting machines to do things without us specifically saying, Do this, then do that, then do this.

DL:deep learning or deep neural networks is just one of the techniques for implementing machine learning.
For now, you can just think of it as a type of algorithm.
But then we have this thing of data science, and often the role of a data science and a machine learning


DS:
often the role of a data science and a machine learning expert are quite overlapping, and most job descriptions actually
don't even have a clear distinction between what is a machine learning expert and a data science expert.
The field of data science simply means analyzing data, looking at data, and then doing something with it, usually some
sort of a business goal. So when we talk about machine learning, there's a lot of overlap with data science.'''

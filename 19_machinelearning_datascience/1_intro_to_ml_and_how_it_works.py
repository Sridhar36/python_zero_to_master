You see, it all starts with A.I. or artificial intelligence, which simply means a human intelligence exhibited by
machines. An A.I. is, well, a machine that acts like a human. And currently in our industry we have something called
narrow A.I. that is, machines can be just as good or even better than humans at a specific task.
For example, detecting heart disease from images or at the game of go or even video games.
But narrow A.I. that we have currently simply means those machines can only do one thing really well.
They can't be like humans and have multiple abilities.
That's called General A.I. and it's something that we're very, very far away from.


ML:
Now machine learning is a subset of AI, and machine learning is an approach to try and achieve artificial intelligence
through systems that can find patterns in a set of data. And actually, Stanford University describes machine learning as
the science of getting computers to act without being explicitly programmed.
That is, getting machines to do things without us specifically saying, Do this, then do that, then do this.

DL:deep learning or deep neural networks is just one of the techniques for implementing machine learning.
For now, you can just think of it as a type of algorithm.
But then we have this thing of data science, and often the role of a data science and a machine learning


DS:
often the role of a data science and a machine learning expert are quite overlapping, and most job descriptions actually
don't even have a clear distinction between what is a machine learning expert and a data science expert.
The field of data science simply means analyzing data, looking at data, and then doing something with it, usually some
sort of a business goal. So when we talk about machine learning, there's a lot of overlap with data science.'''

what is Machine learning ?

in useful functions we create, we give the input and we code the function in such a way that we expect some output.

In Machine Learning, we give input and output and we expect the functions created out of it.. those are called 
Algorithms or models or brains etc.. Disadvantage of this is that these algos gets complex and complex over the time.

History of data : https://www.udemy.com/course/complete-python-developer-zero-to-mastery/learn/lecture/16361652#notes

spreadsheets > SQL(RDBMS) > BigData(noSQL, mongoDB) > MachineLearning

Because at some point we have so much data that as humans we can't just look like we did at spreadsheets and look at 
columns and rows and make business decisions. I mean, we still could, but then we'd be wasting all this data that we've 
been getting over the years. So companies like Facebook and Google that collect massive amounts of data every single day
are turning to things like machine learning so that instead of humans looking at the data and trying to figure things
out, we give this data to machines so that they're better able, even better than humans to make business decisions.
And this idea of machine learning really came to be because of this growth in data that we received from businesses, as 
well as the improvements in CPUs, GPUs, that is, graphical processing units and computer advancements. So using the 
massive amounts of data and massive improvements in computation, we can use these machines to give them this big data 
and make decision for us, just like we used to with spreadsheets. Now, this is a simplified version of how we got here, 
but I hope it gives you a reason as to why businesses like this idea of machine learning. '''

What is ML?
But at the end of the day, the only reason that we care about machine learning is that we're able to
use machines to predict results based on incoming data.

ML categories:
supervised - input is already classified like already having been stored in CSV files.
Unsupervised - clusters of data
Reinforcement - teaching machines thru trial and error. '''

Machine Learning 101:
steps or procedure of ML analyst or expert work:
1. import the data
2. clean the data
3. split the data into training set or test set. eg: out of 100 - 80 training sets / 20 test sets
4. create a model. Most probably you import some algorithm that is present already in existing modules.
5. check or test the output using test set.
6. Improve
 
Difficult part is getting data.'''

'''
tools needed for ML: 
whenever we create ML algos using Python we just gather data and use some of the libraries in Python like numPy and 
Pandas etc.,
Numpy - list and arrays
Pandas - tables, CSV data
Scikit - prebuilt with algos to do classification, clustering etc iof data
matplotlib - charting library - allows us to visualize data.
Jupyter notebooks - very useful for ML and DS; it is like a proper notebook that allows us to
communicate with others in team as well.

Kaggle  -  community of Data scientists, that has data sets and supports the Jupyter notebooks.

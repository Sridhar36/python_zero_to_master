1. Dont learn a language as if you want to memorize everything. Learn on how
to google the stuff and find solutions.,

2. code commenting is a good habit.

3. a good dev should be able to decide when to use which data structure.
- like deciding when to use dict vs list
- dict has no order vs list has an order, etc.,. you need to think of
- dicts will hold keys vs lists just the indexes


4. Clean, Readability, predictability, DRY (Do not repeat yourself)
- comments and naming variables has to be good.
- even others who see your code has to understand.
- predictability - others should be able to predict and understand your code.
- DRY: do not have repetative code.. creating reusable functions is better approach

5. Always test your assumptions.  try to print that unknwon values or whatever you are not aware.. like print
self or print type of values.

6. be careful about the packages we use So you have to develop that skill to make sure you're able to see, hey, this package is really popular

or this package is being maintained or this library is really popular with the community.

So most likely it's a good package to use.

So this is a skill that you need to develop.

Also keep in mind that every time you add a library to, let's say, your project, you're adding more

and more code, which means more and more bytes of data so your project gets heavier and heavier and

heavier.

So that's also something that you want to consider before you're importing a library.

1. Dont learn a language as if you want to memorize everything. Learn on how
to google the stuff and find solutions.,

2. code commenting is a good habit.

3. a good dev should be able to decide when to use which data structure.
- like deciding when to use dict vs list
- dict has no order vs list has an order, etc.,. you need to think of
- dicts will hold keys vs lists just the indexes


4. Clean, Readability, predictability, DRY (Do not repeat yourself)
- comments and naming variables has to be good.
- even others who see your code has to understand.
- predictability - others should be able to predict and understand your code.
- DRY: do not have repetative code.. creating reusable functions is better approach

5. Always test your assumptions.  try to print that unknwon values or whatever you are not aware.. like print
self or print type of values.

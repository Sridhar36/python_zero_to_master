https://pypi.org/  true power of python comes from community i.e pypi

Python is such a big part of any company really in this day and age and why Python has just exploded in popularity is
because of this third part. It's because of developers like you and I who have the ability to create our own python files.
Thousands, millions, trillions of python files and actually share them with each other so that we can actually, instead
of just having our own code, our own standard library code that we download with our python interpreter, also have all
the code that others share on the internet so that we don't keep reinventing the wheel. If somebody else wrote a really,
really good module that maybe can be used in another project across the world, well, they can share it and we can import
we can download that module and import it into our projects. And that's why really amazing libraries like NumPy, pandas,
TensorFlow, all these things that we're going to talk about later in the course are libraries built by the outside
developer community, not the Python community, but in general, just developers like you and I or developers working at
Google. It could be developers that are working in South Africa that are working in Fiji. It doesn't matter. We're able
to use each other's code.And we're able to do that using the PIP install command. And in these next couple of videos,
you're going to see the true power of Python, how we're able to stand on the shoulders of giants, learn from previous
mistakes so that we don't constantly reinvent the wheel. If we want to build a game, if we want to build a website,
we don't have to code it absolutely from scratch. We can use bits and pieces, modules and libraries from all these
different parts to combine it so that we can fast track and build our project even faster. So how can we do this?
How can we use this knowledge base of the world? Well, we have a website for that. It's called the Python Package Index
or BI for short, as you can see, pi pi dot org. And right now there are 182,000 projects. 335,000 users on this website
that have shared code that you can use.

1. just search for the action you need using search.

good practice is to check in the Python module index in the builtin module.. if we don't have any that would solve our
purpose, then we can go search in PyPI.

we can check details for the package like git-hub stars or forks.
stars - people who liked the pkg.
fork - people who use it.

suggestion:
1. first google for built-in eg: built-in module for CSV handling
2. then google for PyPi eg: module for CSV handling pypi
'''

# PIP install

'''
we can install packages from terminal or cmd with pip install package 
or
we can install from interpreter settings.


sometimes
'''

# we can call methods by directly importing and using it
# import re
# re.search()


'''
pip3 always operates on the Python3 environment only, as pip2 does with Python2. pip operates on whichever environment 
is appropriate to the context. For example if you are in a Python3 venv, pip will operate on the Python3 environment.

Virtual env:
We've learned the true power of Python and the true power of Python comes from the community and the
fact that there are so many Python developers that we're able to leverage all these modules, all these
libraries that people have built to really do really interesting things so that we can fast track our
progress and build some really great projects really, really fast, something that we're definitely

version format :  pip 21.2.4  
4 - four usually a version where if you have bug fixes, you would go from zero to 1 to 2 to 3 to 4 ....
2 - two will be a new release, maybe some added features and the last number or based
21 - first number, the major number is usually breaking changes or major versions.

versions will always keep improving.

we can have a separate venv for each project and it helps as we can hold separate or supported version
of each package in respective venv of each project,.

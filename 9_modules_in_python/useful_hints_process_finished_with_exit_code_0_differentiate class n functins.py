Differentiate class vs Function:
whenever you come across any existing code where you see imports. Then if imported item name starts with capitol then
it is class and others are just functions.

from collections import Counter, defaultdict, OrderedDict

here Counter  and OrderedDict are classes; defaultdict is function.

'''
Error handling - a great programmer should always be able to handle the errors in their programs.

built in exceptions list: https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html
We can directly mention these in the except

raise can be used when the execution needs to be stopped.

------

when you do not want your program to fail even when an error occurs and instead raise an
exception you can use try, catch, finally or exception handling.

try: when gets the error and sends control to except block
except: same like catch in Java. we handle error here.

eg: you are expecting some pop up in your automation script and you did not find it
In that case you need not fail the test and wants to proceed.. you can use try catch block here.

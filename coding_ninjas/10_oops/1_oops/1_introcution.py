'''
OOPS - Object oriented programming system. Any language that supports this system is called Object
oriented programming language.

Object:
Anything you see in real world can be represented as an object in programming world.
An object is instance of a class
eg: Bike --> it has identity such as unique name
         --> it has state such as Bike color
         --> it has behaviour like drive, brake, accelerate

Class:
It is a blueprint of an object. Itâ€™s just a plan which does not consume any memory.
A class is a blueprint for creating objects.
For example: If you wish to build a house on a piece of land, you would require
a map for your house. Since using same map, you can create several houses and
that map will not consume any memory.

Eg: Personal Class --> It has attributes like name, age, gender, occupation etc.,
                   --> It has functionalities like walk(), Eat(), Sleep(), Work() etc.,

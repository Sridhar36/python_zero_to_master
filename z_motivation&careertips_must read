dev lifecycle:

- learning - everything new
- employment phase - imposter syndrome { you think you donno anything & you think you were hired by mistake }

	trick - ask more questions & try to grab as much as possible from people. Dont feel asking questions makes you feel dumb.., this is wrong, Everyone doesnot know everything. Everyone learns from asking Qs

- Dev phase or exp phase :

	trick: don't become overconfident. Do not think only you know everything. Always be open to grasp knowledge from time to time. take the inputs from everyone.

-------------------------

remote work is Amazing !
working for others passion is what we do in firms, doing repetetive tasks, working for self is Amazing.

--------------------------

As people get more experienced, they develop strong opinions. Tend to impose these on freshers or the folks you guide.,

---------------------------

Solve your own problems and code them, that is the best way to code. Think of a project or task and automate it.

---------------------------

Freelancing :
- time consuming to get clients and work done.
- upwork.. bid to get the work done.
- You have to have an established client base, else, freelance is something bad for you.,

----------------------------

Why the tool is built?
why are we using? why is this way?

learn fundamentals and not the syntax.

be selective in what you learn instead learning everything.
Enjoy learning. Look for future.

-----------------------------

being physically active and mentally strong is good.
Doing something other then coding from time to time is really needed. Coding makes everything very much fast paced in mind. So go for the hobbies with opposite nature, like meditating.. practising mind to keep still. This will make possible to establish the mental stability.

------------------------------

Interview approach: everyone is not perfect. So dont panic. The guy who is taking your interview just like you. He might know somethings you do not know. So just take it easy and go for it.

Look at interviews as a game.

-------------------------------

Biggest hurdle after changing the stream or getting into a new technology?

Imposter syndrome : getting frightened about the changes in the env. And fearing to ask Qs. Just remember, no one is perfect and you are not an imposter. Always ask questions. Keep asking the questions.. That will help you guys understand multiple things. This will help you grow faster.

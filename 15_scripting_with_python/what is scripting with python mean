But what do I really mean by scripting? This is just a general term to say that. Well, we're writing scripts. Scripts
using Python to do something for us, to use the power of the machines to help us be more productive, more efficient.
So this section is all about making our lives easier, understanding what the power of Python is, what
we've learned up until now, and how we can use it to make our lives easier. We're going to learn about processing images
really efficiently. We're going to learn about working with files like PDFs. We're going to learn how to send emails
with Python, even text messages. We're going to build a Twitter bot. We're also going to build projects along the way to
show you all the cool things we can do with Python. My favorite project that we're going to build is a super secure
password checker to see if our passwords have ever been hacked. It's a really, really neat project.
But the idea here is that with Python using all these libraries and modules that have been built by
the Python community, we can do so much. So it's going to be a really exciting section and it's going to open up a whole
world of possibilities. I'm only going to scratch the surface, but I guarantee you by the end of it, you're going to be
really excited and truly understand the power of Python.

VENV
to create venv:
	install - pip install virtualenvwrapper-win
	cmd to create -  mkvirtualenv test


Django:

pip install django

version: django-admin --version

to create django project:

django-admin startproject telusko  {telusko here is project name}

this will create the project folder named telusko..

inside telusko folder that is created...
1. we have one telusko folder, inside this we have init, settings, urls, wsgi
2. manage.py file


To run this project we need Django server..

Python manage.py runserver


----

static pages vs dynamic pages..

static - same page for every user
dynamic - every user has a separate dynamic content. Like Facebook feed / instagram feed for each user.

---

In Django.. each web page we treat as a single app. Like your login page is one app and the home app page another app likewise..

We have to make sure we are same venv in the terminal..

to work on a env or to set a env in python terminal we use cmd : workon envname

to create app: python manage.py startapp calc


now we see a calc app below folders..

amdin - admin stuff
apps
models - ORM model
tests
views

-----

To drive dynamic changes:

# Create your views here.

# def home(request):
#     return HttpResponse("Hello World")
'''
Here in http response you can add your HTML code like <p>Hello World</p> etc.,
but dont you think that will create a mess here,. So  you can add your html files in project and call those files here.
Which will be a static content.

But if you want dynamic content, then you have something like templates in Django. Concept is called DTL..
Django Template Language.,

We can have HTML page and in that we have dynamic content.


'''


def home(request):
    return render(request, 'home.html', {'name': 'SridharGoud'})


we send this name to html file and in html we use {{ }} to grab these text.

'''
A decorator in Python is a function that takes another function as its argument, and returns yet another function.
Decorators can be extremely useful as they allow the extension of an existing function, without any modification
to the original function source code.

adv:
- These are some extra features that can be used to make code more convinient
an easy to use.
- to check the performance of the functions before deploying
- used a lot in Python frameworks and libraries
- we can use authenticator or logging or login decorator
